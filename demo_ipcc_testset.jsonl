Long-term Climate Change\nThe uncertainty range on assessed future changes in global \nsurface temperature is narrower than in the AR5. For the \ufb01rst \ntime in an IPCC assessment cycle, multi-model projections of global \nsurface temperature, ocean warming and sea level are constrained \nusing observations and the assessed climate sensitivity. The likely \nrange of equilibrium climate sensitivity has been narrowed to 2.5\u00b0C \nto 4.0\u00b0C (with a best estimate of 3.0\u00b0C) based on multiple lines of \nevidence112, including improved understanding of cloud feedbacks. For \nrelated emissions scenarios, this leads to narrower uncertainty ranges \nfor long-term projected global temperature change than in AR5. \n{WGI A.4, WGI Box SPM.1, WGI TS.3.2, WGI 4.3}\nFuture warming depends on future GHG emissions, with \ncumulative net CO2 dominating.\n\nDocument 123: 71\nLong-Term Climate and Development Futures\nSection 3\n3.1.2 Impacts and Related Risks\nFor a given level of warming, many climate-related risks are \nassessed to be higher than in AR5 (high con\ufb01dence).

Panel (a) presents selected mitigation and adaptation options across different systems. The left hand side \nof panel (a) shows climate responses and adaptation options assessed for their multidimensional feasibility at global scale, in the near term and up to 1.5\u00b0C global warming. As \nliterature above 1.5\u00b0C is limited, feasibility at higher levels of warming may change, which is currently not possible to assess robustly. The term response is used here in addition to \nadaptation because some responses, such as migration, relocation and resettlement may or may not be considered to be adaptation. Migration, when voluntary, safe and orderly, \nallows reduction of risks to climatic and non-climatic stressors. Forest based adaptation includes sustainable forest management, forest conservation and restoration, reforestation \nand afforestation. WASH refers to water, sanitation and hygiene. Six feasibility dimensions (economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and geophysical) were used \nto calculate the potential feasibility of climate responses and adaptation options, along with their synergies with mitigation. For potential feasibility and feasibility dimensions, the \n\ufb01gure shows high, medium, or low feasibility. Synergies with mitigation are identi\ufb01ed as high, medium, and low. The right-hand side of panel (a) provides an overview of selected \nmitigation options and their estimated costs and potentials in 2030. Relative potentials and costs will vary by place, context and time and in the longer term compared to 2030. Costs \nare net lifetime discounted monetary costs of avoided greenhouse gas emissions calculated relative to a reference technology. The potential (horizontal axis) is the quantity of net \nGHG emission reduction that can be achieved by a given mitigation option relative to a speci\ufb01ed emission baseline. Net GHG emission reductions are the sum of reduced emissions \nand\/or enhanced sinks. The baseline used consists of current policy (around 2019) reference scenarios from the AR6 scenarios database (25\u201375 percentile values).
