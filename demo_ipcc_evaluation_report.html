In the very low and low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6), CO2 emissions decline to net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively, followed by varying levels of net negative CO2 emissions. In contrast, the high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) have CO2 emissions that roughly double from current levels by 2100 and 2050, respectively.

Unsustainable agricultural expansion driven by unbalanced diets can further increase vulnerability and competition for land and water resources, exacerbating challenges related to food production and water availability.\\n\\nRegions expected to be most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on food production and availability of drinking water include Africa, Asia, Central and South America, Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Islands, and the Arctic.","The latest IPCC report suggests that marine heatwaves are expected to become more frequent and severe as global temperatures continue to rise.","According to the latest IPCC assessment:\\n- In the year 2021, the atmospheric concentrations were 415 parts per million for carbon dioxide (CO2), 1896 parts per billion for methane (CH4), and 335 parts per billion for nitrous oxide (N2O).\\n- In comparison to previous years, specifically in 2019, the concentrations were 410 ppm CO2, 1866 ppb CH4, and 332 ppb N2O.","Approximately 80% of the world&#x27;s coal reserves must remain unutilized to limit global warming to 2\\u00b0C with an 83% probability.","The various colors and patterns of hexagons in the inhabited regions figure in the IPCC AR6 WGI report correspond to the confidence levels and data availability regarding observed climatic changes. Striped hexagons (white and light-grey) indicate low agreement in the type of change for the region as a whole, while grey hexagons represent limited data and/or literature that prevents a comprehensive assessment. Other colors used in the figure indicate at least medium confidence in the observed changes.","A significant volcanic eruption would temporarily and partially mask human-caused climate change effects in the short term by reducing global surface temperature and precipitation, especially over land, for a period of one to three years.","The anticipated reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050, relative to 2019 levels, under the pathways designed to keep temperature increases to no more than 1.5\\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels with a greater than 50% likelihood and minimal overshoot is 84%.","The integration of varied knowledge systems and the forging of partnerships, particularly with marginalized groups such as women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and ethnic minorities, facilitates climate resilient development by enabling locally appropriate and socially acceptable solutions.","Cumulative CO2 emissions are expected to intensify climate hazards, leading to more frequent and intense marine heatwaves, permafrost thawing, loss of seasonal snow cover, glaciers, land ice, and Arctic sea ice. This intensification will also amplify the global water cycle, increasing variability in global monsoon precipitation, very wet and very dry weather events, and seasons. The impact of cumulative CO2 emissions on climate hazards is irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales, particularly affecting the ocean, ice sheets, and global sea level.\\n\\nIn terms of implications for ecosystem and human risk levels, increasing cumulative CO2 emissions could lead to higher risks of species extinction and irreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems like forests, coral reefs, and Arctic regions. There is also a risk of large-scale singular events or tipping points, such as ice sheet instability or ecosystem loss from tropical forests, which could transition to high or very high risk levels with further warming. The response of biogeochemical cycles to anthropogenic perturbations may be abrupt at regional scales and irreversible on decadal to century time scales, with the probability of crossing uncertain regional thresholds increasing with continued warming.","The updated likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity in the IPCC&#x27;s assessment is 2.5\\u00b0C to 4.0\\u00b0C, with a best estimate of 3.0\\u00b0C. This range is narrower than the range presented in the AR5 report.","The specific barriers in developing countries, especially the least developed ones, that hinder the uptake of low-emission technologies despite the recognized need for such innovations include limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building.","Food security could be impacted by approximately 2\\u00b0C global warming through projected increases in direct flood damages, which are estimated to be higher compared to 1.5\\u00b0C global warming without adaptation. Additionally, at 2\\u00b0C global warming, there could be a very high extinction risk for endemic species in biodiversity hotspots, which is projected to increase significantly compared to warming from 1.5\\u00b0C to 2\\u00b0C.\\n\\nThe availability and quality of diets could be impacted by approximately 2\\u00b0C global warming through estimated increases in nutrition-related diseases and the number of undernourished people. This impact is projected to affect tens to hundreds of millions of people, particularly among low-income households in low- and middle-income countries in specific regions like sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central America.\\n\\nLow-income households in low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central America are predicted to be most at risk in terms of food security due to approximately 2\\u00b0C global warming.","The projected CO2 emissions for the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) are expected to decline to net zero around 2050, followed by varying levels of net negative CO2 emissions. \\n\\nFor the low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6), the projected CO2 emissions are projected to decline to net zero around 2070, followed by varying levels of net negative CO2 emissions.","The projected range of equilibrium climate sensitivity according to the IPCC report is 2.5\\u00b0C to 4.0\\u00b0C, with a best estimate of 3.0\\u00b0C. \\n\\nIn terms of regional variations in greenhouse gas emissions, the report outlines different scenarios with varying levels of warming based on different greenhouse gas emission pathways. These scenarios include very low GHG emissions leading to 1.4\\u00b0C warming, intermediate GHG emissions leading to 2.7\\u00b0C warming, and very high GHG emissions resulting in 4.4\\u00b0C warming by 2100. This indicates that the range of equilibrium climate sensitivity may differ across various regions depending on their greenhouse gas emission levels and pathways.","The specific risks to food and nutritional security that North America faces, as outlined in the IPCC report, include potential impacts on food availability, diet quality, and nutrition-related diseases due to changes in climate. These changes could affect the population&#x27;s access to food and nutrition, particularly in regions already facing vulnerabilities. Additionally, there may be risks to cities, settlements, and key infrastructure in North America with further global warming, especially in areas already exposed to high temperatures or along coastlines.\\n\\nIn comparison, vulnerabilities to food and nutritional security in other regions as outlined in the IPCC report include increased risks of nutrition-related diseases and undernourishment affecting tens to hundreds of millions of people, particularly in low-income households in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central America. Additionally, projections indicate a decline in snowmelt water availability for irrigation in some snowmelt-dependent river basins by up to 20%. Climate change risks to cities, settlements, and key infrastructure are expected to rise sharply with further global warming, especially in areas already exposed to high temperatures, along coastlines, or with high vulnerabilities.","The involvement of Indigenous Peoples and local communities, as highlighted in the IPCC report, has had a significant impact on climate action and addressing challenges such as threats to food security and economic disruption due to environmental changes. Their participation has led to deeper ambition and accelerated action in addressing climate challenges. By incorporating traditional knowledge and diverse perspectives into mitigation and adaptation strategies through collective and participatory decision-making processes, Indigenous Peoples and local communities have contributed to building public support for climate action and effectively addressing these challenges.","The regions categorized under Australasia contribute to global CO2 and non-CO2 emissions reductions. The specific regions included in Australasia and their contributions to these emissions reductions can vary. To provide more detailed information on the regions and their contributions, I can run a query to gather more specific data. Would you like me to proceed with this query?","The updated likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity as reported in the IPCC&#x27;s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) is 2.5\\u00b0C to 4.0\\u00b0C, with a best estimate of 3.0\\u00b0C.","The agriculture sector is identified as having the highest percentage (~60%) of adaptation responses to manage water-related risks and impacts in the projected scenarios and adaptation strategies outlined in the IPCC report.","The projected consequences of failing to meet investment needs for urgent, effective, and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions against climate change include:\\n\\n1. Continued disproportionate impacts on the poorest and most vulnerable populations.\\n2. Increased economic and non-economic losses and damages.\\n3. Challenges in redirecting capital towards climate action due to various barriers within and outside the global financial sector.\\n\\nFinancial and technological resources are crucial for effective and ongoing implementation of adaptation measures, especially when supported by institutions with a strong understanding of adaptation needs and capacity. The IPCC report emphasizes the significant need for financial, technical, and human resources for adaptation, particularly in scenarios aiming to limit global warming to 2\\u00b0C or 1.5\\u00b0C. The report indicates that average annual modelled mitigation investment requirements for the period 2020 to 2030 would need to be three to six times greater than current levels, with total mitigation investments across all sectors and regions needing to increase.","The IPCC report highlights that the projected impacts on fisheries are expected to vary by region in response to ocean physical and biogeochemical changes. It mentions changes in maximum fisheries catch potential by 2081\\u20132099 relative to 1986-2005 at projected global warming levels (GWLs) of 0.9\\u00b0C to 2.0\\u00b0C and 3.4\\u00b0C to 5.2\\u00b0C. The report indicates that large relative changes in low yielding regions may correspond to small absolute changes. Additionally, it notes that biodiversity and fisheries in Antarctica were not analyzed due to data limitations.","The confidence level in the assertion that demand-side measures could substantially lower global greenhouse gas emissions in end-use sectors by the year 2050 relative to baseline scenarios is very high. \\n\\nDemand-side measures could lead to significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions in end-use sectors by 2050. These measures could result in socio-economic impacts such as changes in infrastructure use, alterations in land-use patterns driven by shifts in food demand, and modifications in socio-cultural factors. Environmentally, these measures could contribute to a substantial decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in sectors like buildings, land transport, and food, potentially achieving reductions of 40-70% compared to baseline scenarios. However, it is noted that certain regions and socioeconomic groups may require additional energy and resources to implement these demand-side measures effectively.","Accelerated adaptation responses for coastal communities vulnerable to increased sea level rise can provide significant benefits by effectively addressing the challenges posed by sea level rise. These responses, if planned well ahead and aligned with sociocultural values, can enhance protection, accommodation, advance, and planned relocation efforts. By combining and sequencing these responses, coastal communities can better manage the impacts of sea level rise, reduce exposure to climate risks, and engage in inclusive community processes for sustainable adaptation.\\n\\nThe increased rates of sea level rise reported by the IPCC are as follows: 1.3 mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, 1.9 mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and 3.7 mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018.","The primary constraints in transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation, as outlined in the IPCC report, include financial limitations, governance challenges, institutional barriers, and policy constraints.","Delayed mitigation action can have a significant impact on the efficacy of adaptation strategies, as highlighted in the IPCC report. The limitations of models in representing extreme climatic conditions and ecosystem responses can further exacerbate the challenges faced in implementing effective adaptation measures.\\n\\nThe IPCC report emphasizes that delayed mitigation action can reduce the effectiveness of many adaptation options, including Ecosystem-based Adaptation and water-related options. This delay not only hinders the implementation of adaptation strategies but also increases the risks associated with mitigation feasibility, especially for options based on ecosystems.\\n\\nTherefore, it is crucial to address the limitations of models and take timely and decisive mitigation actions to enhance the efficacy of adaptation strategies and effectively respond to extreme climatic conditions and ecosystem responses.","Projected demand-side measures in water-intensive industries could contribute to the reduction of global GHG emissions by 40-70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios. Integrated planning approaches in urban systems, incorporating physical, natural, and social infrastructure, contribute to the reduction of global GHG emissions by 2050 through a combination of strategies. These approaches involve combining green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure adaptation responses, which have the potential to reduce adaptation costs and contribute to various aspects such as flood control, sanitation, water resources management, landslide prevention, and coastal protection. By prioritizing finance to reduce climate risk for low-income populations and considering climate change impacts and risks in the design and planning of urban and rural settlements and infrastructure, these integrated planning approaches can enhance human well-being and resilience. Additionally, mitigation interventions for buildings at different stages - construction, use, and disposal - can significantly reduce emissions by incorporating low-emission construction materials, efficient building envelopes, renewable energy solutions, efficient appliances/equipment, and recycling and reusing construction materials. Furthermore, transport-related GHG emissions can be reduced through demand-side options, low-GHG emissions technologies, changes in urban form, reallocating street space for cycling and walking, digitalization, and promoting changes in consumer behavior towards more energy-efficient transport modes like electric vehicles powered by low-emissions electricity.","Unabated greenhouse gas emissions are anticipated to lead to more frequent and intense marine heatwaves. Efforts to ensure ecosystem services and support vulnerable communities intersect with the challenge of unabated greenhouse gas emissions. This intersection highlights the importance of implementing sustainable land use practices, such as conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests and other ecosystems. These actions not only contribute to mitigating climate change but also provide essential ecosystem services that benefit both the environment and vulnerable communities. Additionally, addressing unabated greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for reducing the impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations, such as those living in low-lying coastal areas, by helping to minimize risks associated with sea level rise and land subsidence.","The factors identified in the IPCC report that influence the timing at which different countries might achieve net zero emissions include equity considerations, capacity constraints, and the incorporation of equity principles.","The estimated reductions in global GHG emissions by 2050 for scenarios aiming to cap warming at 1.5\\u00b0C are projected to be 84% below 2019 levels. For scenarios targeting a 2\\u00b0C cap on warming, the estimated reductions in global GHG emissions by 2050 are projected to be 64% below 2019 levels.\\n\\nThese reductions in global GHG emissions are expected to correlate with increased mitigation costs but also with significant economic benefits from reduced climate impacts and decreased adaptation needs.","Climate change affects food security in different regions by reducing overall agricultural productivity, slowing growth in agricultural productivity globally, impacting crop yields negatively in mid- and low latitude regions, and leading to some positive impacts in high latitude regions. Additionally, climate change contributes to an overall decrease in maximum catch potential in oceans, adversely affecting food production from shellfish aquaculture and fisheries in certain oceanic regions. The impacts of climate change on food security are particularly severe in regions like Africa, Asia, Central and South America, LDCs, Small Islands, and the Arctic, affecting small-scale food producers, low-income households, and Indigenous Peoples globally.\\n\\nThe impacts of climate change on food security are exacerbated by warming, changing precipitation patterns, loss of cryospheric elements, and increased frequency and intensity of climatic extremes. These factors have led to a reduction in food security and water security, hindering efforts to meet Sustainable Development Goals and exposing millions of people to acute food insecurity and reduced water security. The largest impacts are observed in regions such as Africa, Asia, Central and South America, LDCs, Small Islands, and the Arctic, affecting small-scale food producers, low-income households, and Indigenous Peoples globally.","The unit costs of solar energy, wind energy, and lithium-ion batteries decreased from 2010 to 2019. Specifically, the unit costs of solar energy and wind energy decreased during this period. Additionally, the unit costs of lithium-ion batteries decreased from $800 per kWh in 2010 to $150 per kWh in 2019.\\n\\nThese reductions in unit costs play a significant role in the feasibility of system transitions in energy as outlined by the IPCC report. Lower costs of solar energy, wind energy, and lithium-ion batteries make renewable energy sources more competitive with traditional fossil fuels. This affordability encourages the adoption of renewable energy technologies, which are crucial for achieving the goals of transitioning to a more sustainable and low-carbon energy system as recommended by the IPCC report.","Individuals with high socio-economic status can play a crucial role in climate change mitigation and adaptation by supporting policies that promote economic and energy sector diversification, considering just transitions principles, processes, and practices.","Factors increasing vulnerability to climate change for Indigenous Peoples and local communities include inequity, marginalization, historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, limited access to basic services and resources, governance challenges, poverty, violent conflict, and high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods. \\n\\nHistorical inequities related to gender, ethnicity, and income have been identified as factors that contribute to increased vulnerability to climate change.","The IPCC report emphasizes the importance of equity, inclusion, and just transitions in climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. These principles are crucial for achieving sustainable outcomes, reducing trade-offs, supporting transformative change, and advancing climate resilient development. Prioritizing equity, climate justice, rights-based approaches, and social justice can lead to more effective adaptation and mitigation actions across different scales, sectors, and regions. Additionally, redistributive policies, social safety nets, and just transitions are essential for protecting vulnerable populations from the impacts of climate change and enabling deeper societal ambitions for sustainable development goals.","The likelihood of global warming reaching 1.5\\u00b0C between 2021 and 2040 under very low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios is high. In most considered scenarios and modelled pathways, global warming is expected to reach 1.5\\u00b0C in the first half of the 2030s. Specifically, in the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), CO2 emissions are projected to reach net zero around 2050, with an end-of-century warming estimate of 1.4\\u00b0C.","The development of synthetic diagrams for regions like Small Islands, Asia, and Central and South America was limited due to several factors. These include the lack of adequately downscaled climate projections, uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies and socioeconomic contexts across countries within a region, and the resulting few numbers of impact and risk projections for different warming levels.","The IPCC report highlights that delayed mitigation actions will lead to further increases in global warming. This, in turn, will reduce the effectiveness of many adaptation options, including Ecosystem-based Adaptation and various water-related options. Furthermore, delayed mitigation actions increase the risks associated with the feasibility of mitigation, especially for options based on ecosystems.","The projected global warming outcomes for modelled pathways based on policies implemented until the end of 2020 indicate a global warming of 3.2\\u00b0C (with a range of 2.2 to 3.5\\u00b0C) by the year 2100, with medium confidence.","To achieve deep emissions reductions and ensure a liveable and sustainable future for all, rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary. This includes integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, incorporating measures like cash transfers and public works programs supported by basic services and infrastructure. Additionally, prioritizing equity, inclusion, just transitions, and broad participation in decision-making processes at all scales can enable deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation and climate action.\\n\\nBy integrating social equity into climate change adaptation strategies, redistributive policies across sectors and regions can protect the poor and vulnerable, while social safety nets can contribute to resolving trade-offs with sustainable development goals. Prioritizing equity, climate justice, rights-based approaches, social justice, and inclusivity in adaptation and mitigation actions can lead to more sustainable outcomes, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change, and advance climate resilient development.","The probability of peak global warming remaining under 1.5\\u00b0C according to the latest IPCC report is 38%.","The IPCC report states that coral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70\\u201390% if global warming reaches 1.5\\u00b0C.

This indicates that a significant number of species, out of the tens of thousands assessed, are likely to face a very high risk of extinction at this temperature increase.","The IPCC report highlights that if urgent, effective, and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions are not taken, the consequences include escalating adverse impacts, related losses and damages due to climate change, further global warming, reduced effectiveness of many adaptation options, and increased risks associated with mitigation feasibility, especially for options based on ecosystems. It emphasizes the importance of taking immediate action to address these challenges.","Coastal cities play a crucial role in advancing climate resilient development due to several key factors:\\n\\n1. High Population Density: Coastal cities are often located in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone, where population density is high. This makes them particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise, storm surges, and flooding. Developing climate resilient strategies in these cities is essential to protect the lives and livelihoods of millions of people.\\n\\n2. Increasing Risks: Coastal cities face increasing risks from climate-related factors, including extreme weather events, coastal erosion, and saltwater intrusion. By implementing climate resilient measures, such as green infrastructure, coastal defenses, and early warning systems, these cities can better adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change.\\n\\n3. Economic Importance: Coastal cities are often economic hubs with significant contributions to national economies. Investing in climate resilient development in these cities can help safeguard critical infrastructure, businesses, and industries from climate risks, ensuring the long-term sustainability and prosperity of these urban centers.\\n\\nOverall, coastal cities have the potential to lead the way in advancing climate resilient development by integrating adaptation and mitigation measures into their urban planning and infrastructure projects. By prioritizing resilience, these cities can build a more sustainable and secure future for their residents and contribute to global efforts to address climate change.","The limited development of synthetic diagrams for Small Islands, Asia, and Central and South America in the IPCC report was primarily due to the following reasons:\\n\\n1. Scarcity of adequately downscaled climate projections: There was a lack of sufficient downscaled climate projections for these regions, which resulted in uncertainty regarding the direction of change and made it challenging to create comprehensive synthetic diagrams.\\n\\n2. Diversity of climatologies and socioeconomic contexts: The diverse climatologies and socioeconomic contexts across countries within these regions added complexity to the analysis. This diversity made it difficult to generalize impacts and risks, leading to a smaller number of available projections for different warming levels.\\n\\nThese factors combined contributed to the limitation of synthetic diagrams for Small Islands, Asia, and Central and South America in the IPCC report.","Integrating green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure adaptation responses, as described in the latest IPCC report, can reduce adaptation costs and provide various benefits such as flood control, sanitation, water resources management, landslide prevention, and coastal protection. This integrated approach offers a comprehensive strategy to address climate change impacts and brings multiple benefits to the environment and communities.","In the context of emissions pathways in the IPCC report, square brackets signify the 5th-95th percentile interval. \\n\\nIn the context of net zero in the IPCC report, three dots (...) signify that net zero has not been reached for that percentile. \\n\\nSquare brackets also signify the 5th-95th percentile interval in the context of net zero in the IPCC report.","The GHG emissions intensity in terms of tCO2-eq per USD1000PPP for Africa in 2018 is 0.78, and for North America in 2018 is 0.30.\\n\\nApproximately 87% of the global population lives in countries emitting more than 6 tCO2-eq per capita and less than 3 tCO2-eq per capita.","Concurrent and cascading risks to human systems posed by climate change include impacts on food systems, human settlements, infrastructure, and health. These risks are projected to become more severe and challenging to manage, especially when interacting with non-climatic risk drivers such as competition for land between urban expansion and food production, and pandemics. Loss of ecosystems and their services can have cascading and long-term impacts, particularly affecting Indigenous Peoples and local communities who rely directly on ecosystems for basic needs. Additionally, increasing transboundary risks are expected across the food, energy, and water sectors as impacts from weather and climate extremes propagate through supply-chains, markets, and natural resource flows, potentially interacting with other crises such as pandemics.\\n\\nClimate change exacerbates risks to food systems and health by introducing concurrent and cascading risks that make these challenges more severe and harder to manage. These risks interact with non-climatic factors such as competition for land between urban expansion and food production, as well as pandemics. Loss of ecosystems and their services has long-term impacts, particularly affecting Indigenous Peoples and local communities reliant on ecosystems for basic needs. Additionally, transboundary risks are projected across food, energy, and water sectors due to weather and climate extremes, which can propagate through supply-chains, markets, and natural resource flows. Responses aimed at mitigating climate change can also introduce risks, such as maladaptation and adverse side effects of certain emissions reduction measures, further compounding risks to biodiversity, food and water security, and livelihoods.","The non-bracketed values in the &#x27;Temperature Change&#x27; and &#x27;Likelihood&#x27; columns of the IPCC pathways categories represent the 50th percentile across the pathways in that category and the median across the warming estimates of the probabilistic MAGICC climate model emulator.\\n\\nCO2 emissions are projected to reach net zero around 2050 for the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) and around 2070 for the low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) in the IPCC pathways categories.","The deployment of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods in climate change mitigation has various potential impacts, risks, and roles associated with it:\\n\\n1. **Potential Impacts**:\\n   - CDR methods have varying levels of maturity, removal process, time scale of carbon storage, storage medium, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, impacts, risks, and governance requirements.\\n   - Methods range from lower to higher maturity, removal and storage potential, and costs.\\n   - Estimated storage timescales vary depending on the method used, with some storing carbon for decades to centuries while others for ten thousand years or more.\\n   - Afforestation, reforestation, improved forest management, agroforestry, and soil carbon sequestration are currently the most widely practiced CDR methods.\\n   - Deployment of CDR methods in global mitigation pathways depends on assumptions about costs, availability, and constraints.\\n\\n2. **Risks**:\\n   - Risks associated with the deployment of CDR methods include variability in impacts, risks, and co-benefits depending on the method, site-specific context, implementation, and scale.\\n   - Challenges related to dependence on CDR, pressure on land and biodiversity, and uncertainties regarding the potential impacts on ecosystems, biodiversity, and people.\\n   - The risks can be highly variable and may have significant implications based on the specific circumstances of CDR deployment.\\n\\n3. **Roles**:\\n   - Roles associated with the deployment of CDR methods include lowering net CO2 or net GHG emissions in the near term.\\n   - Counterbalancing &#x27;hard-to-abate&#x27; residual emissions to help reach net zero CO2 or GHG emissions.\\n   - Achieving net negative CO2 or GHG emissions if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions.\\n\\nThese aspects highlight the complexity and considerations involved in the deployment of CDR methods for climate change mitigation.","In the context of the IPCC report, the three dots (...) in the projected global warming levels signify a range of values or a continuation of the sequence being discussed. \\n\\nThe projected pathways in the IPCC report are categorized based on their likelihood of limiting warming to different peak warming levels (if peak temperature occurs before 2100) and 2100 warming levels.","By the early 2050s, 100% of the net zero CO2 pathways need to be achieved according to the data provided.
